# Description

This project is a simplified API for tracing Java based distributed systems, as well as an implementation based on the OpenTracing instrumentation framework and the Jaeger tracing engine.

In this book you will first find a small explanation of the tracing model, then a high-level description of the APIs and some instruction on when to use each API.
